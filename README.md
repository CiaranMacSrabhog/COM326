Solutions will be posted here weekly (I will try to get it up by Friday)

+ For Week 1 Session 1 & 2
The Repo consists of three Visual Studio projects, one for each of the challenges.
If you want to change the project that executes when pressing CTRL+F5 in VS then right click on the desired project in the project explorer. Then choose the option "Set as startup project"
+ Week 2 Session 1
Open the main VC solution from the "Solution for Week 2" folder to view the complete solution of the challenges.
